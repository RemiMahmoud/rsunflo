  title = {{T}hresholds for leaf expansion and transpiration response to soil
	water deficit in a range of sunflower genotypes},
  journal = {European Journal of Agronomy},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {28},
  pages = {646--654},
  abstract = {The sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) crop in southern Europe suffers
	from intense and frequent periods of water deficit. Minimisation
	of water loss in response to water deficit is a major aspect of drought
	tolerance and can be achieved through the lowering of either leaf
	area expansion rate or transpiration per unit leaf area (stomatal
	conductance). During three greenhouse pot experiments, leaf expansion
	(LE) and transpiration (TR) rates were monitored as the soil dried
	progressively for about 15 days. This study aimed to quantify the
	response of these two physiological processes to water deficit, expressed
	as the fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW): response thresholds
	(onset of decline) were estimated on 25 sunflower genotypes from
	different generations of selection history. From these relationships,
	the thresholds below which LE and TR started to decrease from the
	control were calculated: little change was observed until FTSW was
	close to 0.6 for leaf expansion and 0.4 for daily transpiration.
	Variability in the response of all genotypes for expansion and transpiration
	control was better described using specific thresholds for each genotype
	rather than generic thresholds for sunflower. The ranking of genotypes
	was found to be unaffected for transpiration rate control, but this
	was not the case for leaf expansion. Identified response thresholds
	were not mutually correlated, suggesting that sunflower controls
	leaf expansion and transpiration rate independently. Neither was
	correlated with the release date of the genotype, suggesting that
	these traits were not subject to selection within evaluation environments.},

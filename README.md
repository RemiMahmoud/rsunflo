# rsunflo
Tools for phenotyping, simulating and modelling with the SUNFLO crop model

A set of tools for working with the SUNFLO crop model at different steps. 
* To deal with input data, rsunflo includes tools for computing genotypic input parameters and creating input climatic files.
* Multi-simulation is simplified with tools for designing virtual experiments and process to simulation.
* Tools for tracking the variation of prediction capacity along with model development are also included.

To install the development version of `rsunflo` please use the `devtools` package:

    # install.packages("devtools")
    library(devtools)
    install_github("rsunflo", "picasa")

Please see the [user manual](inst/doc/workflow.md) for a description the model parameterization and workflow for simulation.

Title: Tools for phenotyping, simulating and modelling with the SUNFLO crop model
Description: A set of tools for working with the SUNFLO crop model at different steps. 
	The input step is covered with tools for computing genotypic input 
	parameters from phenotyped variables and dealing with file formats
	of input variables.
	Multi-simulation is simplified with tools for designing virtual
	experiments and simulating.
	Tools for tracking the variation of prediction capacity along
	with model developement are also included
